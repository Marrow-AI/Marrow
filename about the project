In machine learning (ML), we design models based on our definition of intelligence, reproducing our conceptual mind and ways of thinking. 
This project explores the most influential ML modes through a psychological lens, questioning whether the black box of AI looks more like our own mental states than we might believe.
We are all a result of how and where we are raised â€“ if AI achieves its promise, what kinds of independent thinking entities will grow from our designs?

this project is an interactive web about the mental states of the intelligence machines we create.
